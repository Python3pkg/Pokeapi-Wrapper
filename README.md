# Pok-api-Wrapper
#A wrapper for the Pok√©api in python

# Purpose

This wrapper simplifies the retrieval and parsing of data from the database. All methods either return a string, number or a dictionary that you can loop through to find what data you want. I will be adding more features as time passes 

# Usage

First you must import the class like: 

`import Pokemon

Then you must create an object of Pokemon and pass the name of the pokemon you wish to retrieve information about like:

` charizard = Pokemon("charizard")

Following are a list of methods that you can use currently:

'getMoves()
